# Tic Tac Toe
Java Swing based tic-tac-toe game.
Designed and programmed for my 2-2  project.
A fun game that involves 2 players marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 board with the objective of getting one type of marking 3 in a row; horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
It also consists of single player where the player plays with the computer.In single player the computer will train you about the game and tactics invovled in it.
